## :memo: Description

With this project I've been tasked to create an object that accepts an integer
representing a user's age on Earth, and then having methods that return a value
that represents the inputted age as it would be on other planets. There are
other methods as well. One determines the number of years left to a person of
that age based off a life expectancy of 81, and the other will return an array
of strings representing all the names of the planets we can determine the age of
a person on.
